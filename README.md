# My-Alphabet-Game
Kids letter matching game
*Note: I am having trouble getting the game loop to render in the tkinter window. Advice appreciated.
This game uses Tkinter for GUI.

Upon clicking start, the game will present a single random letter, either upper or lower case.

The player must then input the correct corresponding letter, example below:

Output: f

Correct input: F

The game will loop through 10 questions while tracking the score.

At the end, the game will display the score and ask if you want to play again.
